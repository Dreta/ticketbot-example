# Ticket Bot Example

If you're like me, then an example is really worth 1,024 words, which is
why I created this repo. It includes a reimplementation of the built-in
StringStepType, demonstrating the power of extensions in ticket bot,
including custom step types and custom configuration.

## Build

Ticket Bot builds with Maven 3.

```
mvn package
```

## License

```
Ticket Bot allows you to easily manage and track tickets.
